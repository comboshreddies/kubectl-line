find a way to make easier for redirecting
ie 
_ api-r | _ get {{kind}} -A -o json > /tmp/{{ns}}_{{kind}}_{{name}}.json
does not work as _ in moment of _ get {{kind}} is not aware of ns and name

_ get ... | _ @  /tmp/{{abcd}}

-----

kci -> kc-inject

dumpToDir context <path> 
 -> api-r | get kind -A | get kind name | @ /path 

get kind itemList splitter for faster dump
/ simbol , no get kind name is needed (it should be able to read yaml/json)
should work only for json by default, it should check if it's yaml it shoud
yell error
so _ api-r | _ get kind -A | _ % /path/

or dump /path

_ . <shortcut> name for shorcut
_ . dump

_ split 

TODO TO FIX
does not work for multiple object_names:
_ -n test-run get pod busybox1-7f67945dfc-sn529 nginx-sample1-6475dd48b7-wwktz -o json | less
TO FIX improve objects detection, provide a list

TO IMPROVE
for _ ? maybe I could
_ ? COLUMN 'expr' 'expr'
it would be interpreted as 
'expr' and 'expr' and ...
then decode expr one by one
nicer than parsing 
_ -n test-run get pod | _ ? RESTARTS ?1 ge 3 | _ ? RESTARTS ?1 le 5
maybe something like .. | _ ? RESTARTS '?1 ge 3' '?1 le 5'
